# FashionMNIST

Here are some mini projects using the fashion MNIST dataset. 
The dataset includes 28x28 pixel images of different articles of clothing, labelled.


## Convolutional Neural Network
The first thing I did was build a classifier using a simple convolutional neural network. The main motivation was to get some more experience using CNNs and gaining some more understanding of how the various hyperparameters and model architectures affect performance. In the end, I was able to get over a 91% classification accuracy and a cross entropy loss under of under 3 (varying slightly for each trained model). More details and code can be found in the CNN code in this project.
